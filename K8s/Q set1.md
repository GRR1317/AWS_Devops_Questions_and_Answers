## why we need k8s?
Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s (with "8" replacing the eight letters between "K" and "s"), is an open-source container orchestration platform that has become a fundamental tool in modern application deployment and management. There are several reasons why Kubernetes is widely adopted and considered essential in the world of containerized applications:

1. **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes provides a powerful framework for orchestrating and managing containers. Containers are a lightweight and efficient way to package and deploy applications, but they need orchestration to run seamlessly at scale. Kubernetes automates tasks like container scheduling, scaling, load balancing, and self-healing, making it easier to deploy and manage containerized applications.

2. **Scalability:** Kubernetes allows you to scale your applications up or down effortlessly. It can automatically adjust the number of container instances (pods) based on CPU and memory usage or custom metrics. This ensures that your applications can handle varying workloads and traffic levels.

3. **High Availability:** Kubernetes is designed for high availability. It can distribute your application across multiple nodes (servers) and ensure that it remains available even if some nodes or containers fail. This helps minimize downtime and improves the reliability of your applications.

4. **Portability:** Kubernetes provides a consistent environment for deploying applications, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This means you can run your applications on a variety of cloud providers, on-premises data centers, or even in hybrid environments without making significant changes to your application code.

5. **Resource Efficiency:** Kubernetes optimizes resource utilization by intelligently placing containers on nodes with available resources. This helps reduce infrastructure costs and ensures efficient use of CPU and memory.

6. **Declarative Configuration:** Kubernetes allows you to define your application's desired state using declarative configuration files (YAML or JSON). The platform then continuously works to maintain that desired state, automatically creating or updating resources as needed. This simplifies application management and reduces manual intervention.

7. **Ecosystem and Extensibility:** Kubernetes has a vast ecosystem of extensions and tools. You can extend its functionality through custom resource definitions (CRDs), operators, and Helm charts. This ecosystem enables you to customize Kubernetes to meet your specific needs.

8. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** Kubernetes provides built-in service discovery and load balancing for your applications. This simplifies communication between different parts of your application and ensures that traffic is evenly distributed.

9. **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks:** Kubernetes supports rolling updates and rollbacks for your applications. You can update your application without downtime and easily revert to a previous version if issues arise during deployment.

10. **Security:** Kubernetes includes features for securing containerized applications, such as network policies, role-based access control (RBAC), and pod security policies. These features help protect your applications and data.

## explain k8s architecture?
Kubernetes (K8s) has a distributed architecture designed to provide scalability, resilience, and flexibility for containerized applications. Its architecture consists of several key components that work together to manage containerized workloads efficiently. Below, I'll explain the core components and their roles in the K8s architecture:

1. **Master Node (Control Plane):**
   - **API Server:** The API server is the central control point of the entire Kubernetes cluster. It exposes the Kubernetes API, which clients (like `kubectl` or automation tools) use to interact with the cluster. It validates and processes requests, serving as the entry point for cluster management.

   - **etcd:** etcd is a distributed key-value store used to store all cluster data. It acts as Kubernetes' source of truth, storing configuration data, state information, and other critical data. The consistency and reliability of etcd are crucial for the stability of the cluster.

   - **Controller Manager:** The Controller Manager includes various controllers that handle different aspects of the cluster's desired state. Examples include the Replication Controller, which manages replica sets, and the Node Controller, which monitors and manages nodes.

   - **Scheduler:** The Scheduler component assigns pods (containers) to nodes based on resource requirements, policies, and constraints. It ensures that pods are distributed across the cluster effectively and optimally.

2. **Node (Minion):**
   - **Kubelet:** Kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It communicates with the API server to manage containers on that node. It starts, stops, and monitors containers, ensuring that they run as specified in their pod definitions.

   - **Container Runtime:** The container runtime, such as Docker or containerd, is responsible for actually running containers on the node. Kubelet interacts with the container runtime to create and manage containers.

   - **Kube Proxy:** Kube Proxy is responsible for network communication within the cluster. It manages network rules (like iptables rules) to provide network services to pods, such as load balancing and network routing.

   - **CRI (Container Runtime Interface):** CRI is an interface between Kubelet and the container runtime. It standardizes how Kubelet communicates with container runtimes, allowing for flexibility in choosing different container runtimes.

3. **Networking:**
   - Kubernetes relies on a network overlay or plugin to enable pod-to-pod communication. Common solutions include Calico, Flannel, and Weave. These network plugins handle routing, IP address assignment, and network policies within the cluster.

4. **Add-Ons:**
   - Kubernetes can be extended with various add-ons to enhance its functionality. These add-ons include the Kubernetes Dashboard for web-based cluster management, DNS for service discovery, and Ingress controllers for managing external access to services.

5. **Custom Resources and Extensions:**
   - Kubernetes allows for custom resource definitions (CRDs) and extensions, which enable you to define and manage custom resources and controllers. This extensibility is used for creating custom resources like Operators that automate complex application management tasks.

## diff bet docker-swarm and k8s and docker ?

**Docker:**

1. **Containerization Platform:** Docker is a platform that enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into containers. These containers are isolated and can run consistently across different environments, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications.

2. **Single Host Focus:** Docker is primarily designed for running containers on a single host. While it's possible to manage containers on multiple hosts manually, Docker does not provide built-in tools for orchestrating containers across a cluster of machines.

3. **Lightweight:** Docker is lightweight and easy to set up. It's suitable for local development, testing, and running individual containers.

**Docker Swarm:**

1. **Container Orchestration:** Docker Swarm is a native container orchestration tool provided by Docker. It allows you to manage a cluster of Docker hosts and deploy containers across them.

2. **Simplicity:** Docker Swarm is known for its simplicity and ease of use. It's a good choice if you're looking for basic orchestration capabilities without the complexity of Kubernetes.

3. **Limited Features:** While Docker Swarm is straightforward to set up and manage, it has fewer features compared to Kubernetes. It may be a good choice for smaller or less complex applications but may lack some advanced capabilities required for large-scale or complex deployments.

**Kubernetes (K8s):**

1. **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform that can manage and orchestrate containers at scale across a cluster of machines. It offers advanced features for deployment, scaling, load balancing, and more.

2. **Complexity:** Kubernetes is more complex to set up and manage compared to Docker Swarm, but it provides a wide range of features and flexibility. It's well-suited for large, complex, and production-grade applications.

3. **Ecosystem:** Kubernetes has a vast ecosystem of extensions, tools, and third-party integrations. It supports a wide range of deployment strategies, including rolling updates, canary releases, and blue-green deployments.

4. **Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Support:** Kubernetes is designed for multi-cloud and hybrid cloud deployments. It provides a consistent platform for running applications across various cloud providers and on-premises infrastructure.

## What is init container and can have multiple init container?
An init container, short for initialization container, is a special type of container in Kubernetes that runs before the main application containers in a pod start. Init containers are primarily used to perform setup tasks, such as initializing a database, downloading configuration files, or waiting for external services to become available. They ensure that certain conditions are met or that specific resources are available before the main application containers begin executing.

## What is liveness , readyness and start probe in k8s?
In Kubernetes (K8s), liveness probes, readiness probes, and startup probes are mechanisms used to improve the reliability and availability of containerized applications running in pods. These probes help Kubernetes determine the health and readiness of a pod and its containers. Here's an overview of each probe type:

1. **Liveness Probe:**
   
   - **Purpose:** The liveness probe determines whether a container within a pod is running correctly. If a liveness probe fails, Kubernetes considers the container unhealthy and attempts to restart it.
   
   - **Use Cases:** Liveness probes are used to detect and recover from situations where a container becomes unresponsive, stuck, or deadlocked. For example, you can use a liveness probe to check if a web server within a container is still responding to requests.

   - **Probe Configuration:** A liveness probe typically consists of an HTTP GET request, TCP socket check, or an execution of a custom command within the container. You specify a path, port, or command to execute, and Kubernetes periodically checks the result.

2. **Readiness Probe:**
   
   - **Purpose:** The readiness probe indicates whether a container is ready to serve traffic. When a container is not ready (as determined by a failed readiness probe), Kubernetes stops sending network traffic to that container.
   
   - **Use Cases:** Readiness probes are crucial for ensuring that only healthy containers receive incoming traffic. This prevents users or clients from interacting with applications that may still be initializing or not fully functional. For example, a database container may need time to initialize before accepting connections.

   - **Probe Configuration:** Like the liveness probe, the readiness probe can also use HTTP GET requests, TCP socket checks, or custom commands to determine readiness. It is essential to configure it to match the criteria that define when the application is ready to serve traffic.

3. **Startup Probe:**
   
   - **Purpose:** The startup probe is a relatively new addition to Kubernetes (as of my last knowledge update in September 2021). It's specifically designed to determine when a container has started successfully. Unlike liveness and readiness probes, which run periodically after the container is running, the startup probe only runs at the beginning of a container's lifecycle.
   
   - **Use Cases:** The startup probe is useful for applications that take some time to initialize or require complex startup procedures. It helps ensure that a container has successfully completed its startup sequence before it's considered ready or healthy.

   - **Probe Configuration:** The configuration of a startup probe is similar to that of liveness and readiness probes. You can specify an HTTP GET request, TCP socket check, or a custom command to check the container's readiness.

## What is CRD in k8s?
In Kubernetes (K8s), a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) is an extension mechanism that allows you to define custom resources and their schema within a K8s cluster. CRDs enable you to extend the Kubernetes API and create custom resources that are specific to your applications or use cases. These custom resources can then be managed like built-in K8s resources, such as pods, services, or deployments.

Here are some key points about CRDs:

1. **Definition of Custom Resources:** With CRDs, you define your custom resources by specifying their names, structure (schema), and additional validation rules. This schema defines the structure and characteristics of your custom resources, including their fields and data types.

2. **Custom Resource Instances:** Once you've defined a CRD, you can create instances of your custom resources, which are sometimes referred to as Custom Resource Objects (CROs). These instances conform to the schema you defined in the CRD.

3. **Kubectl Support:** Kubectl, the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters, provides commands for creating, updating, and managing custom resources just like it does for built-in resources. For example, you can use `kubectl create`, `kubectl get`, `kubectl describe`, and `kubectl delete` to work with custom resources.

4. **Operators and Controllers:** CRDs are often used in conjunction with Operators or Controllers. An Operator is a custom controller that watches for changes to custom resources and takes actions based on those changes. For example, you could create a custom resource for a specific application, and an Operator could automatically deploy and manage instances of that application based on the custom resource specifications.

5. **Custom Resource Use Cases:** CRDs are incredibly versatile and can be used for various purposes, such as defining custom application configurations, managing stateful applications, creating network policies, and more. They're particularly useful for automating complex operational tasks that involve custom logic.

Here's a simplified example of how you might define a Custom Resource Definition for a fictional "WebApp" resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: webapps.example.com
spec:
  group: example.com
  names:
    kind: WebApp
    plural: webapps
    singular: webapp
  scope: Namespaced  # CRDs can have cluster-wide or namespaced scope
  versions:
    - name: v1
      served: true
      storage: true
  validation:
    openAPIV3Schema:
      type: object
      properties:
        spec:
          type: object
          properties:
            replicas:
              type: integer
            image:
              type: string
```

In this example, we define a CRD named `webapps.example.com` that describes a custom resource called `WebApp`. The schema includes fields for specifying the number of replicas and the container image for the web application.

Once you've defined the CRD, you can create instances of `WebApp` resources in your cluster, and you can build custom controllers or operators to manage these resources according to your application's requirements.

## what is namespace and resource quota?
**Namespace**:
A namespace in Kubernetes is a logical partition or virtual cluster within a physical Kubernetes cluster. It allows you to create isolated environments for your applications and resources.

**Resource Quota**:
Resource quotas in Kubernetes are used to limit the amount of CPU, memory, and other resources that can be consumed by objects (e.g., pods, services) within a namespace. They help prevent individual applications or teams from consuming all available cluster resources and ensure fair sharing of resources.

## What is pod?
In Kubernetes, a Pod is the smallest deployable unit that represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster. A Pod can contain one or more containers, which are tightly coupled and share the same network namespace, storage, and other resources. Pods are the basic building blocks for deploying applications in Kubernetes, and they serve as the fundamental unit of deployment

## what is statefulset in k8s?
In Kubernetes, a StatefulSet is a resource type that is used to manage the deployment and scaling of stateful applications. StatefulSets are designed for applications that require stable and unique network identities, stable storage, and ordered, graceful scaling and termination. They are especially useful for running databases, messaging systems, and other applications that have stateful characteristics.

## what is your role in k8s?
As a DevOps engineer working with Kubernetes (K8s), my role involves managing the deployment, scaling, and overall lifecycle of containerized applications in a K8s environment. Here are some key responsibilities and activities that are typically part of my role:

1. **Containerization and Docker:** I work with application development teams to containerize their applications using technologies like Docker. I ensure that containers are built efficiently, follow best practices, and are optimized for K8s deployment.

2. **Kubernetes Deployment:** My role includes deploying and managing K8s clusters. This involves provisioning nodes, configuring networking, and setting up security measures to ensure a secure and stable K8s environment.

3. **Application Deployment:** I collaborate with development teams to define K8s deployment manifests (YAML files) for applications. These manifests describe how the applications should be deployed, including the desired number of replicas, resource requirements, and configuration settings.

4. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** I establish and maintain CI/CD pipelines that automate the building, testing, and deployment of containerized applications to K8s clusters. This includes setting up tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or other CI/CD systems.

5. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** I use infrastructure as code tools like Terraform or Ansible to define and provision the necessary infrastructure for K8s clusters and related resources (e.g., load balancers, databases).

6. **Monitoring and Logging:** I set up monitoring and logging solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack) to gather metrics and logs from K8s clusters and applications. I create alerts and dashboards to ensure timely detection of issues.

7. **Scaling and Optimization:** I monitor resource utilization and scale K8s workloads up or down as needed to maintain performance and cost efficiency. This involves implementing Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) and other scaling mechanisms.

8. **Security:** I implement security best practices to secure K8s clusters and applications. This includes role-based access control (RBAC), network policies, image scanning, and secrets management.

9. **Backup and Disaster Recovery:** I plan and implement backup and disaster recovery strategies for K8s workloads and data. This ensures data resilience and business continuity in case of failures.

10. **Troubleshooting and Support:** I assist development teams in troubleshooting issues related to application deployments and K8s infrastructure. I also provide support during incidents and outages to restore services quickly.

11. **Documentation and Training:** I maintain documentation for deployment procedures, configurations, and best practices. I also provide training to development teams on K8s concepts and best practices.

12. **Stay Informed:** The world of K8s and DevOps is ever-evolving. I continuously stay informed about new K8s features, best practices, and emerging technologies to ensure that our K8s infrastructure remains up-to-date and efficient.

## How can you create cluster?
Creating a Kubernetes cluster, whether managed in the cloud or on-premises, involves several steps and considerations. I'll provide a high-level overview of the process for both scenarios:

**Creating a Managed Kubernetes Cluster (Cloud Provider)**:

1. **Select a Cloud Provider:** Choose a cloud provider that offers managed Kubernetes services. Popular options include Amazon EKS (AWS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS).

2. **Access Cloud Console:** Log in to your cloud provider's management console.

3. **Create a Cluster:** In the console, navigate to the Kubernetes or Container Service section and create a new Kubernetes cluster. You'll need to specify cluster details like the region, version, node pool configuration, and networking options.

4. **Node Configuration:** Configure the worker nodes (virtual machines) that will run your cluster. You can specify the number of nodes, their machine types, and any additional features like auto-scaling.

5. **Network Configuration:** Set up the networking for your cluster, including VPC peering, network policies, and firewall rules. This ensures that your cluster can communicate with other services in your cloud environment.

6. **Cluster Security:** Configure security settings, such as role-based access control (RBAC), identity and access management (IAM), and secrets management to secure your cluster.

7. **Cluster Creation:** Initiate the cluster creation process, and the cloud provider will provision the control plane and worker nodes for you.

8. **Kubeconfig:** After the cluster is provisioned, download the cluster's kubeconfig file, which you'll use to interact with the cluster using `kubectl`.

9. **Configuration and Deployment:** Install any additional tools and configure your local environment to work with the cluster. Deploy applications and workloads to the cluster.

**Creating an On-Premises Kubernetes Cluster**:

Creating an on-premises Kubernetes cluster typically involves more manual steps and hardware provisioning. Here's an outline of the process:

1. **Plan Hardware:** Determine the hardware requirements for your cluster, including the number of physical or virtual machines, CPU, memory, and storage capacity. Ensure that you have sufficient resources for your workloads.

2. **Select an OS:** Choose an operating system (e.g., Linux distribution) for your cluster nodes. Ensure that it's compatible with Kubernetes.

3. **Install Kubernetes:** Manually install Kubernetes components on your cluster nodes. This includes the Kubernetes control plane components (kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler) and container runtime (Docker, containerd, etc.).

4. **Networking Setup:** Configure networking between cluster nodes, including network addresses, DNS resolution, and firewall rules. Ensure that nodes can communicate with each other and access external resources as needed.

5. **Cluster Initialization:** Initialize the Kubernetes cluster by running `kubeadm init` on the control plane node. This generates a kubeconfig file and join tokens for worker nodes.

6. **Node Join:** Join worker nodes to the cluster by running `kubeadm join` with the generated join tokens.

7. **Kubeconfig and Tools:** Set up the kubeconfig file on your management machine to access the cluster. Install `kubectl` and any other Kubernetes-related tools you need.

8. **Configuration and Deployment:** Configure cluster features, such as RBAC, networking plugins (e.g., Calico, Flannel), and storage solutions (e.g., local storage, Ceph, NFS). Deploy your applications and workloads to the cluster.

9. **Monitoring and Management:** Implement monitoring and logging solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack) and backup strategies to ensure cluster reliability and recoverability.

Creating an on-premises Kubernetes cluster typically requires more planning, hardware provisioning, and manual setup compared to managed cloud offerings. The exact steps may vary depending on your specific on-premises infrastructure and requirements.

## what is affinity, tent and toleration?
In the context of Kubernetes, affinity, taints, and tolerations are mechanisms used to influence the scheduling and placement of pods on nodes within a cluster. They help you define rules and constraints for how pods should be distributed across the available nodes.

1. **Affinity:**

   - **Node Affinity:** Node affinity is a way to specify rules that influence the scheduling of pods based on the characteristics of nodes. It can be categorized into two types:
     - **Required Node Affinity:** Specifies that a pod must be scheduled on nodes that meet certain conditions. For example, you can require a pod to be scheduled on nodes with a specific label or in a particular zone.
     - **Preferred Node Affinity:** Suggests that a pod should be scheduled on nodes that meet certain conditions but allows the pod to be placed on other nodes if no suitable ones are available.

   - **Pod Affinity/Anti-Affinity:** Pod affinity and anti-affinity rules are used to influence how pods are scheduled relative to other pods. They can be categorized into two types:
     - **Required Pod Affinity/Anti-Affinity:** Specifies that a pod must be scheduled with or without other pods that meet certain conditions. For example, you can require a pod to be scheduled on nodes with pods running a specific application.
     - **Preferred Pod Affinity/Anti-Affinity:** Suggests that a pod should or should not be scheduled with other pods that meet certain conditions but allows flexibility based on node availability.

   - **Use Cases:** Affinity rules are useful for scenarios where you want to ensure that pods are co-located or separated based on specific criteria, such as spreading workloads across availability zones for fault tolerance, or grouping pods that share data on the same node for low-latency communication.

2. **Taints and Tolerations:**

   - **Taints:** A taint is a property assigned to a node that repels pods. Nodes can be "tainted" with certain characteristics, such as hardware limitations or specialized hardware, by the cluster administrator. Taints prevent general-purpose pods from being scheduled on nodes unless the pods have corresponding tolerations.

   - **Tolerations:** A toleration is an attribute added to a pod specification that allows the pod to tolerate nodes with specific taints. In other words, it specifies that certain pods can be scheduled on nodes with particular taints. Tolerations are set at the pod level.

   - **Use Cases:** Taints and tolerations are useful for scenarios where you have nodes with specialized hardware or resource constraints. For example, you can taint nodes with GPUs, and pods that require GPU resources can be configured with tolerations to ensure they are scheduled on GPU-equipped nodes.

## Can i shedule Pod in master?
In Kubernetes, it's generally not recommended to schedule regular application Pods on the master nodes. Master nodes are a critical part of the control plane and are responsible for managing the overall cluster. They run essential components such as the API server, etcd, controller manager, and scheduler, which are vital for the functioning and control of the cluster.

## what is minions in k8s node?
A node is a working machine in Kubernetes cluster which is also known as a minion. They are working units which can be physical, VM, or a cloud instance.

## what are kubeproxy and CNI?
**Kube-proxy** and **CNI (Container Networking Interface)** are two essential components in Kubernetes that play crucial roles in networking within a Kubernetes cluster:

**Kube-proxy:**

1. **Service Proxy:** Kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster. Its primary function is to maintain network rules on nodes, which allows network communication to reach the correct Pods and Services.

2. **Load Balancing:** Kube-proxy implements load balancing for Services of type "LoadBalancer" or "NodePort." It distributes traffic to the appropriate backend Pods associated with a Service.

3. **IPTables or Userspace Modes:** Kube-proxy can operate in either IPTables mode or userspace proxy mode. In IPTables mode (the default in most Kubernetes clusters), it uses IPTables rules to manage network traffic routing and load balancing. In userspace mode, it relies on a userspace proxy program.

4. **EndpointSlices:** In more recent Kubernetes versions, Kube-proxy has transitioned to using EndpointSlices, which improves scalability and performance when managing a large number of endpoints (Pods).

In summary, Kube-proxy is responsible for managing network routing, load balancing, and service discovery within a Kubernetes cluster. It ensures that traffic to Services reaches the appropriate Pods, regardless of the node on which they are running.

**CNI (Container Networking Interface):**

1. **Network Plugin System:** CNI is an interface and standard for connecting container runtimes (e.g., Docker, containerd) to various network plugins. It provides a consistent way to configure networking for containers and Pods.

2. **Network Plugins:** CNI allows you to choose from a variety of network plugins that can implement different networking models, such as bridged networking, overlay networks, or even direct hardware access. Popular CNI plugins include Calico, Flannel, Weave, and many others.

3. **Pod Network:** Each Kubernetes cluster typically uses a specific CNI plugin to manage Pod networking. This plugin is responsible for assigning IP addresses to Pods, setting up network routes, and handling network policies.

4. **Isolation and Security:** CNI plugins offer network isolation and security features, such as network policies, which allow you to control the flow of traffic between Pods.

5. **Integration with Kubernetes:** Kubernetes integrates with CNI by invoking CNI plugins during Pod creation to set up the network interfaces and configurations required for communication between Pods and external networks.

## what is Istio in k8s?
**Istio** is an open-source service mesh platform that can be deployed on Kubernetes and other container orchestration systems. It is designed to help manage and secure microservices-based applications by providing a set of powerful networking, security, and observability features.

Here are some of the key capabilities and components of Istio:

1. **Traffic Management:** Istio offers advanced traffic management features, such as request routing, traffic splitting, and traffic shaping. It allows you to implement canary deployments, A/B testing, and blue-green deployments with ease. You can also set traffic policies and configure timeouts, retries, and circuit breaking for your services.

2. **Load Balancing:** Istio automatically load-balances traffic between instances of your services. It can distribute traffic evenly or based on more advanced load-balancing algorithms.

3. **Service-to-Service Communication:** Istio provides service discovery and facilitates secure and reliable communication between services within a Kubernetes cluster. It automatically generates and manages service certificates, ensuring encryption and authentication.

4. **Security:** Istio enhances security by implementing features like mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication between services. It provides fine-grained access control through policies and enables you to secure your microservices architecture.

5. **Observability:** Istio offers robust observability tools, including distributed tracing (with Jaeger or Zipkin), metrics collection (with Prometheus), and Grafana dashboards. These tools help you gain insights into the behavior of your microservices and troubleshoot issues.

6. **Traffic Telemetry:** Istio collects telemetry data about network traffic between services. This data can be used to monitor performance, detect anomalies, and generate alerts.

7. **Fault Injection and Testing:** Istio allows you to inject faults and delays into your services for testing purposes. This helps you simulate real-world conditions and verify how your applications handle failures.

8. **Extensible:** Istio is highly extensible and can be integrated with other tools and platforms. You can use custom Envoy filters, web assembly (Wasm) modules, and adapters to extend Istio's functionality.

Istio deploys a sidecar proxy (based on Envoy) alongside each microservice in your cluster. This sidecar handles network traffic and enforces policies configured through Istio control plane components, such as Pilot, Mixer, Citadel, and Galley.

## why we go with containers?
Containers offer several benefits that make them a popular choice for software development and deployment. Here are some compelling reasons why organizations and developers choose to use containers:

1. **Isolation**: Containers provide process and file system isolation, allowing you to package an application and its dependencies into a self-contained unit. This isolation ensures that changes or updates to one container do not affect others, reducing compatibility issues and conflicts between applications.

2. **Consistency**: Containers encapsulate an application along with its environment and dependencies. This ensures that the application behaves consistently across different development, testing, and production environments, regardless of variations in the underlying infrastructure.

3. **Portability**: Containers are highly portable and can run consistently across various platforms, such as local development machines, cloud providers, and on-premises servers. This portability streamlines the deployment process and minimizes the "it works on my machine" problem.

4. **Resource Efficiency**: Containers share the host operating system's kernel, which makes them lightweight compared to virtual machines. They consume fewer resources and can be started and stopped quickly, enabling efficient resource utilization and scalability.

5. **Scaling**: Containers make it easier to scale applications horizontally by creating multiple instances of the same container. This dynamic scaling is essential for handling variable workloads and ensuring high availability.

6. **Version Control**: Container images can be versioned, making it easy to track changes and roll back to previous versions when issues arise. This enhances version control and simplifies the release management process.

7. **Dependency Management**: Containers allow you to package all dependencies with the application, reducing the risk of compatibility issues and dependency conflicts. This simplifies software distribution and updates.

8. **DevOps and CI/CD**: Containers are well-suited for DevOps practices and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. They enable automated testing, deployment, and rollback processes, improving development and release workflows.

9. **Security**: Containers can be configured with fine-grained security controls, helping to isolate applications and limit their privileges. Tools like Docker Security Scanning and container orchestration platforms provide security features to further protect containerized applications.

10. **Microservices**: Containers are a natural fit for building and deploying microservices-based architectures. They enable each microservice to run in its own container, facilitating independent development, scaling, and management of microservices.

11. **Resource Isolation**: Containers can be configured to allocate specific CPU and memory resources, ensuring that applications do not monopolize system resources and causing performance degradation for other services.

## what happen when 2 selectores having same name in namespace?
In Kubernetes, when you have two or more selectors with the same name within the same namespace, it can lead to potential conflicts and unexpected behavior when managing resources like Services, Network Policies, and Deployments.

Selectors are labels used to match resources with other resources, typically within the context of Services. Here's what can happen when multiple selectors have the same name within a namespace:

1. **Service Confusion**: If you have multiple Services within the same namespace with selectors having the same name, Kubernetes may not be able to determine which Service should route traffic to which Pods. This can lead to traffic being sent to unintended Pods or Services, causing routing issues and disruptions in your application.

2. **Resource Ambiguity**: In other scenarios, if you have multiple resources (e.g., Deployments, Pods) using the same label selector, it can become difficult to identify which resource corresponds to which. This can make resource management and troubleshooting challenging, as it may not be clear which resources are affected when you apply changes or debug issues.

3. **Network Policy Challenges**: If you are using Network Policies to control network access between Pods based on selectors, having multiple selectors with the same name can create ambiguity and unexpected network behavior. Network Policies might not work as expected, leading to security or connectivity issues.

To avoid these issues, it's essential to ensure that selectors within the same namespace have unique names or label combinations to clearly differentiate resources. By giving each resource a unique selector, you can maintain clear and predictable behavior when managing Services, Network Policies, and other resources.

## what happen when liveness probe is failed?
When a liveness probe fails in Kubernetes, it signifies that the application running in a container is unresponsive or in an unhealthy state. Kubernetes continuously monitors the container's health using liveness probes, and when a failure occurs, Kubernetes takes action based on the configured probe settings. Typically, the following happens:

1. **Container Restart**: Kubernetes will attempt to restart the container that failed the liveness probe. This is done to give the application a chance to recover from the failure. Kubernetes follows the restart policy defined in the Pod specification, which can be set to "Always" (to always restart), "OnFailure" (to restart only on failure), or "Never" (to never restart).

2. **Automatic Recovery**: If the application inside the container can recover from the issue that caused the liveness probe to fail, the container may become healthy again, and Kubernetes will continue to monitor it.

3. **Manual Intervention**: If the liveness probe continues to fail and the container repeatedly restarts without recovering, it may indicate a more severe or persistent issue. In such cases, it may require manual intervention by the operator or developer to diagnose and resolve the underlying problem.

4. **Pod Status Update**: The status of the Pod will reflect the container's health. If the liveness probe repeatedly fails, the Pod's status will be updated to indicate that the container is not ready. This information can be valuable for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

5. **Logs and Metrics**: Kubernetes may capture logs and metrics related to the liveness probe failures, which can be used for diagnosing and troubleshooting issues. These logs and metrics can help identify the cause of the failure and guide the resolution process.

## what happen when readyness probe is failed?
When a readiness probe fails in a Kubernetes Pod, it signals to the Kubernetes control plane that the Pod is not ready to accept incoming network traffic or requests. As a result, the Pod is temporarily marked as "not ready" and is removed from service by Kubernetes. This ensures that only Pods that are fully prepared to handle requests are allowed to receive traffic, maintaining the stability and reliability of the application.

The failing readiness probe can be configured to check various aspects of the application, such as making HTTP requests to a specific endpoint or inspecting the status of a service or database within the Pod. When the probe repeatedly fails to return a successful response within the specified time frame, Kubernetes considers the Pod not ready and may take the following actions:

1. **Pod Eviction**: Depending on your Kubernetes configuration and policies, Kubernetes may terminate the Pod with the failing readiness probe. This can trigger a replacement Pod to be scheduled on a healthy node.

2. **Load Balancer Changes**: If the Pod is part of a Service and is managed by a load balancer (like the Kubernetes Service), the load balancer may remove the failing Pod from its pool of available endpoints, preventing traffic from being routed to it until it becomes ready again.

3. **Health Monitoring**: Kubernetes continuously monitors the readiness status of Pods. Once the readiness probe starts passing successfully, the Pod is marked as "ready" and is reintroduced into the pool of available endpoints for incoming requests.
