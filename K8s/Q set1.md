## why we need k8s?
Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s (with "8" replacing the eight letters between "K" and "s"), is an open-source container orchestration platform that has become a fundamental tool in modern application deployment and management. There are several reasons why Kubernetes is widely adopted and considered essential in the world of containerized applications:

1. **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes provides a powerful framework for orchestrating and managing containers. Containers are a lightweight and efficient way to package and deploy applications, but they need orchestration to run seamlessly at scale. Kubernetes automates tasks like container scheduling, scaling, load balancing, and self-healing, making it easier to deploy and manage containerized applications.

2. **Scalability:** Kubernetes allows you to scale your applications up or down effortlessly. It can automatically adjust the number of container instances (pods) based on CPU and memory usage or custom metrics. This ensures that your applications can handle varying workloads and traffic levels.

3. **High Availability:** Kubernetes is designed for high availability. It can distribute your application across multiple nodes (servers) and ensure that it remains available even if some nodes or containers fail. This helps minimize downtime and improves the reliability of your applications.

4. **Portability:** Kubernetes provides a consistent environment for deploying applications, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This means you can run your applications on a variety of cloud providers, on-premises data centers, or even in hybrid environments without making significant changes to your application code.

5. **Resource Efficiency:** Kubernetes optimizes resource utilization by intelligently placing containers on nodes with available resources. This helps reduce infrastructure costs and ensures efficient use of CPU and memory.

6. **Declarative Configuration:** Kubernetes allows you to define your application's desired state using declarative configuration files (YAML or JSON). The platform then continuously works to maintain that desired state, automatically creating or updating resources as needed. This simplifies application management and reduces manual intervention.

7. **Ecosystem and Extensibility:** Kubernetes has a vast ecosystem of extensions and tools. You can extend its functionality through custom resource definitions (CRDs), operators, and Helm charts. This ecosystem enables you to customize Kubernetes to meet your specific needs.

8. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** Kubernetes provides built-in service discovery and load balancing for your applications. This simplifies communication between different parts of your application and ensures that traffic is evenly distributed.

9. **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks:** Kubernetes supports rolling updates and rollbacks for your applications. You can update your application without downtime and easily revert to a previous version if issues arise during deployment.

10. **Security:** Kubernetes includes features for securing containerized applications, such as network policies, role-based access control (RBAC), and pod security policies. These features help protect your applications and data.

## explain k8s architecture?
Kubernetes (K8s) has a distributed architecture designed to provide scalability, resilience, and flexibility for containerized applications. Its architecture consists of several key components that work together to manage containerized workloads efficiently. Below, I'll explain the core components and their roles in the K8s architecture:

1. **Master Node (Control Plane):**
   - **API Server:** The API server is the central control point of the entire Kubernetes cluster. It exposes the Kubernetes API, which clients (like `kubectl` or automation tools) use to interact with the cluster. It validates and processes requests, serving as the entry point for cluster management.

   - **etcd:** etcd is a distributed key-value store used to store all cluster data. It acts as Kubernetes' source of truth, storing configuration data, state information, and other critical data. The consistency and reliability of etcd are crucial for the stability of the cluster.

   - **Controller Manager:** The Controller Manager includes various controllers that handle different aspects of the cluster's desired state. Examples include the Replication Controller, which manages replica sets, and the Node Controller, which monitors and manages nodes.

   - **Scheduler:** The Scheduler component assigns pods (containers) to nodes based on resource requirements, policies, and constraints. It ensures that pods are distributed across the cluster effectively and optimally.

2. **Node (Minion):**
   - **Kubelet:** Kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It communicates with the API server to manage containers on that node. It starts, stops, and monitors containers, ensuring that they run as specified in their pod definitions.

   - **Container Runtime:** The container runtime, such as Docker or containerd, is responsible for actually running containers on the node. Kubelet interacts with the container runtime to create and manage containers.

   - **Kube Proxy:** Kube Proxy is responsible for network communication within the cluster. It manages network rules (like iptables rules) to provide network services to pods, such as load balancing and network routing.

   - **CRI (Container Runtime Interface):** CRI is an interface between Kubelet and the container runtime. It standardizes how Kubelet communicates with container runtimes, allowing for flexibility in choosing different container runtimes.

3. **Networking:**
   - Kubernetes relies on a network overlay or plugin to enable pod-to-pod communication. Common solutions include Calico, Flannel, and Weave. These network plugins handle routing, IP address assignment, and network policies within the cluster.

4. **Add-Ons:**
   - Kubernetes can be extended with various add-ons to enhance its functionality. These add-ons include the Kubernetes Dashboard for web-based cluster management, DNS for service discovery, and Ingress controllers for managing external access to services.

5. **Custom Resources and Extensions:**
   - Kubernetes allows for custom resource definitions (CRDs) and extensions, which enable you to define and manage custom resources and controllers. This extensibility is used for creating custom resources like Operators that automate complex application management tasks.

## diff bet docker-swarm and k8s and docker ?

**Docker:**

1. **Containerization Platform:** Docker is a platform that enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into containers. These containers are isolated and can run consistently across different environments, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications.

2. **Single Host Focus:** Docker is primarily designed for running containers on a single host. While it's possible to manage containers on multiple hosts manually, Docker does not provide built-in tools for orchestrating containers across a cluster of machines.

3. **Lightweight:** Docker is lightweight and easy to set up. It's suitable for local development, testing, and running individual containers.

**Docker Swarm:**

1. **Container Orchestration:** Docker Swarm is a native container orchestration tool provided by Docker. It allows you to manage a cluster of Docker hosts and deploy containers across them.

2. **Simplicity:** Docker Swarm is known for its simplicity and ease of use. It's a good choice if you're looking for basic orchestration capabilities without the complexity of Kubernetes.

3. **Limited Features:** While Docker Swarm is straightforward to set up and manage, it has fewer features compared to Kubernetes. It may be a good choice for smaller or less complex applications but may lack some advanced capabilities required for large-scale or complex deployments.

**Kubernetes (K8s):**

1. **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform that can manage and orchestrate containers at scale across a cluster of machines. It offers advanced features for deployment, scaling, load balancing, and more.

2. **Complexity:** Kubernetes is more complex to set up and manage compared to Docker Swarm, but it provides a wide range of features and flexibility. It's well-suited for large, complex, and production-grade applications.

3. **Ecosystem:** Kubernetes has a vast ecosystem of extensions, tools, and third-party integrations. It supports a wide range of deployment strategies, including rolling updates, canary releases, and blue-green deployments.

4. **Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Support:** Kubernetes is designed for multi-cloud and hybrid cloud deployments. It provides a consistent platform for running applications across various cloud providers and on-premises infrastructure.

## What is init container and can have multiple init container?
An init container, short for initialization container, is a special type of container in Kubernetes that runs before the main application containers in a pod start. Init containers are primarily used to perform setup tasks, such as initializing a database, downloading configuration files, or waiting for external services to become available. They ensure that certain conditions are met or that specific resources are available before the main application containers begin executing.

## What is liveness , readyness and start probe in k8s?
In Kubernetes (K8s), liveness probes, readiness probes, and startup probes are mechanisms used to improve the reliability and availability of containerized applications running in pods. These probes help Kubernetes determine the health and readiness of a pod and its containers. Here's an overview of each probe type:

1. **Liveness Probe:**
   
   - **Purpose:** The liveness probe determines whether a container within a pod is running correctly. If a liveness probe fails, Kubernetes considers the container unhealthy and attempts to restart it.
   
   - **Use Cases:** Liveness probes are used to detect and recover from situations where a container becomes unresponsive, stuck, or deadlocked. For example, you can use a liveness probe to check if a web server within a container is still responding to requests.

   - **Probe Configuration:** A liveness probe typically consists of an HTTP GET request, TCP socket check, or an execution of a custom command within the container. You specify a path, port, or command to execute, and Kubernetes periodically checks the result.

2. **Readiness Probe:**
   
   - **Purpose:** The readiness probe indicates whether a container is ready to serve traffic. When a container is not ready (as determined by a failed readiness probe), Kubernetes stops sending network traffic to that container.
   
   - **Use Cases:** Readiness probes are crucial for ensuring that only healthy containers receive incoming traffic. This prevents users or clients from interacting with applications that may still be initializing or not fully functional. For example, a database container may need time to initialize before accepting connections.

   - **Probe Configuration:** Like the liveness probe, the readiness probe can also use HTTP GET requests, TCP socket checks, or custom commands to determine readiness. It is essential to configure it to match the criteria that define when the application is ready to serve traffic.

3. **Startup Probe:**
   
   - **Purpose:** The startup probe is a relatively new addition to Kubernetes (as of my last knowledge update in September 2021). It's specifically designed to determine when a container has started successfully. Unlike liveness and readiness probes, which run periodically after the container is running, the startup probe only runs at the beginning of a container's lifecycle.
   
   - **Use Cases:** The startup probe is useful for applications that take some time to initialize or require complex startup procedures. It helps ensure that a container has successfully completed its startup sequence before it's considered ready or healthy.

   - **Probe Configuration:** The configuration of a startup probe is similar to that of liveness and readiness probes. You can specify an HTTP GET request, TCP socket check, or a custom command to check the container's readiness.

## What is CRD in k8s?
In Kubernetes (K8s), a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) is an extension mechanism that allows you to define custom resources and their schema within a K8s cluster. CRDs enable you to extend the Kubernetes API and create custom resources that are specific to your applications or use cases. These custom resources can then be managed like built-in K8s resources, such as pods, services, or deployments.

Here are some key points about CRDs:

1. **Definition of Custom Resources:** With CRDs, you define your custom resources by specifying their names, structure (schema), and additional validation rules. This schema defines the structure and characteristics of your custom resources, including their fields and data types.

2. **Custom Resource Instances:** Once you've defined a CRD, you can create instances of your custom resources, which are sometimes referred to as Custom Resource Objects (CROs). These instances conform to the schema you defined in the CRD.

3. **Kubectl Support:** Kubectl, the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters, provides commands for creating, updating, and managing custom resources just like it does for built-in resources. For example, you can use `kubectl create`, `kubectl get`, `kubectl describe`, and `kubectl delete` to work with custom resources.

4. **Operators and Controllers:** CRDs are often used in conjunction with Operators or Controllers. An Operator is a custom controller that watches for changes to custom resources and takes actions based on those changes. For example, you could create a custom resource for a specific application, and an Operator could automatically deploy and manage instances of that application based on the custom resource specifications.

5. **Custom Resource Use Cases:** CRDs are incredibly versatile and can be used for various purposes, such as defining custom application configurations, managing stateful applications, creating network policies, and more. They're particularly useful for automating complex operational tasks that involve custom logic.

Here's a simplified example of how you might define a Custom Resource Definition for a fictional "WebApp" resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: webapps.example.com
spec:
  group: example.com
  names:
    kind: WebApp
    plural: webapps
    singular: webapp
  scope: Namespaced  # CRDs can have cluster-wide or namespaced scope
  versions:
    - name: v1
      served: true
      storage: true
  validation:
    openAPIV3Schema:
      type: object
      properties:
        spec:
          type: object
          properties:
            replicas:
              type: integer
            image:
              type: string
```

In this example, we define a CRD named `webapps.example.com` that describes a custom resource called `WebApp`. The schema includes fields for specifying the number of replicas and the container image for the web application.

Once you've defined the CRD, you can create instances of `WebApp` resources in your cluster, and you can build custom controllers or operators to manage these resources according to your application's requirements.
