## what is Helm and which helm version you used?
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, which is an open-source container orchestration platform. Helm simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes by providing a templating system for defining, installing, and upgrading even complex Kubernetes applications. Helm uses charts, which are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources, to manage these applications.

1. **No Tiller**: In Helm 2, there was a component called Tiller that needed to be installed in the Kubernetes cluster. Helm 3 removed this requirement, which improved security and made Helm easier to use in different cluster environments.

2. **Chart Dependencies**: Helm 3 introduced a new way of managing chart dependencies, making it more aligned with how other package managers work. It uses a `Chart.yaml` file to define dependencies.

3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Helm 3 supports RBAC out of the box, which makes it more secure and compliant with Kubernetes cluster configurations.

4. **JSON Schema Validation**: Helm 3 introduced JSON schema validation for `values.yaml` files, providing better validation of chart values.

## what is helm chart?
A Helm chart is a collection of pre-configured Kubernetes resources, packaged together for easy deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications on Kubernetes clusters. It provides a templating mechanism and a package structure to define and parameterize complex application configurations, making it a fundamental tool for simplifying application deployment and lifecycle management in Kubernetes environments.

## How helmchart help us to manage k8s cluster?
Helm charts help manage Kubernetes clusters by simplifying the deployment and management of complex applications within the cluster. Here's how Helm charts assist in cluster management:

1. **Standardized Packaging**: Helm charts package Kubernetes manifests and configuration files into a structured format, making it easy to distribute and share applications as self-contained units. This standardization ensures consistency and repeatability when deploying applications across different clusters or environments.

2. **Parameterization**: Helm allows users to parameterize charts using values files or command-line arguments. This flexibility enables customization of application configurations for different clusters, namespaces, or deployment scenarios without modifying the underlying chart, reducing the risk of configuration drift.

3. **Dependency Management**: Helm charts support dependencies, allowing you to define and manage complex application stacks with multiple components. This simplifies the installation and upgrade of applications with intricate interdependencies, ensuring that all required resources are provisioned correctly.

4. **Version Control**: Helm charts can be versioned, enabling you to track changes and roll back to previous versions if necessary. This version control helps maintain application stability and simplifies debugging in case of issues.

5. **Upgrades and Rollbacks**: Helm facilitates application updates and rollbacks by providing commands to easily upgrade or revert to previous chart versions. This helps ensure smooth application lifecycle management and minimizes downtime during updates.

6. **Sharing and Reusability**: Helm charts can be shared through repositories, fostering collaboration and reuse within organizations or the broader community. This sharing of best practices and configurations accelerates application development and deployment.

7. **RBAC and Security**: Helm 3 introduced support for Kubernetes RBAC, enhancing security by limiting access to resources based on role-based access control policies. This aligns Helm with Kubernetes security best practices, making it a safer choice for managing clusters.

8. **Ecosystem Integration**: Helm has a vibrant ecosystem with a wide range of community-contributed charts for popular applications and services. This allows users to quickly adopt and deploy common solutions within their Kubernetes clusters without the need for extensive manual configuration.
