## what is Helm and which helm version you used?
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, which is an open-source container orchestration platform. Helm simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes by providing a templating system for defining, installing, and upgrading even complex Kubernetes applications. Helm uses charts, which are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources, to manage these applications.

1. **No Tiller**: In Helm 2, there was a component called Tiller that needed to be installed in the Kubernetes cluster. Helm 3 removed this requirement, which improved security and made Helm easier to use in different cluster environments.

2. **Chart Dependencies**: Helm 3 introduced a new way of managing chart dependencies, making it more aligned with how other package managers work. It uses a `Chart.yaml` file to define dependencies.

3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Helm 3 supports RBAC out of the box, which makes it more secure and compliant with Kubernetes cluster configurations.

4. **JSON Schema Validation**: Helm 3 introduced JSON schema validation for `values.yaml` files, providing better validation of chart values.

## what is helm chart?
A Helm chart is a collection of pre-configured Kubernetes resources, packaged together for easy deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications on Kubernetes clusters. It provides a templating mechanism and a package structure to define and parameterize complex application configurations, making it a fundamental tool for simplifying application deployment and lifecycle management in Kubernetes environments.

## How helmchart help us to manage k8s cluster?
Helm charts help manage Kubernetes clusters by simplifying the deployment and management of complex applications within the cluster. Here's how Helm charts assist in cluster management:

1. **Standardized Packaging**: Helm charts package Kubernetes manifests and configuration files into a structured format, making it easy to distribute and share applications as self-contained units. This standardization ensures consistency and repeatability when deploying applications across different clusters or environments.

2. **Parameterization**: Helm allows users to parameterize charts using values files or command-line arguments. This flexibility enables customization of application configurations for different clusters, namespaces, or deployment scenarios without modifying the underlying chart, reducing the risk of configuration drift.

3. **Dependency Management**: Helm charts support dependencies, allowing you to define and manage complex application stacks with multiple components. This simplifies the installation and upgrade of applications with intricate interdependencies, ensuring that all required resources are provisioned correctly.

4. **Version Control**: Helm charts can be versioned, enabling you to track changes and roll back to previous versions if necessary. This version control helps maintain application stability and simplifies debugging in case of issues.

5. **Upgrades and Rollbacks**: Helm facilitates application updates and rollbacks by providing commands to easily upgrade or revert to previous chart versions. This helps ensure smooth application lifecycle management and minimizes downtime during updates.

6. **Sharing and Reusability**: Helm charts can be shared through repositories, fostering collaboration and reuse within organizations or the broader community. This sharing of best practices and configurations accelerates application development and deployment.

7. **RBAC and Security**: Helm 3 introduced support for Kubernetes RBAC, enhancing security by limiting access to resources based on role-based access control policies. This aligns Helm with Kubernetes security best practices, making it a safer choice for managing clusters.

8. **Ecosystem Integration**: Helm has a vibrant ecosystem with a wide range of community-contributed charts for popular applications and services. This allows users to quickly adopt and deploy common solutions within their Kubernetes clusters without the need for extensive manual configuration.

## what is helm chart architure?

Helm chart architecture consists of several components and directories that define and structure the Kubernetes resources and configurations needed to deploy an application. Here's an overview of the key elements in a Helm chart:

1. **Chart.yaml**:
   - This file contains metadata about the Helm chart, such as its name, version, and description.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     name: myapp
     version: 1.0.0
     description: My sample application
     ```

2. **values.yaml**:
   - This file holds default configuration values that can be overridden when deploying the chart.
   - Values defined here are used as templates throughout the chart templates.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     replicaCount: 2
     image:
       repository: myapp
       tag: 1.2.3
     ```

3. **templates/**:
   - This directory contains Kubernetes YAML templates that define the resources needed for your application.
   - Helm uses Go templates to inject values from `values.yaml` into these templates.
   - Common resources include Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Ingresses.
   - Example template (e.g., `deployment.yaml`):
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apps/v1
     kind: Deployment
     metadata:
       name: {{ .Release.Name }}-deployment
     spec:
       replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
       template:
         spec:
           containers:
             - name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
               image: {{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag }}
     ```

4. **helpers.tpl** (optional):
   - This file contains reusable Go templates and functions that can be used within other templates.
   - It helps keep chart templates DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
   - Example:
     ```go
     {{/* Reusable template to create a ConfigMap */}}
     {{- define "myapp.configmap" -}}
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: ConfigMap
     metadata:
       name: {{ .Release.Name }}-configmap
     data:
       key1: value1
       key2: value2
     {{- end -}}
     ```

5. **charts/** (optional):
   - This directory is used for storing dependencies on other Helm charts.
   - Helm can manage and deploy these dependencies alongside your main chart.
   - Example:
     ```
     charts/
     ├── common/
     └── frontend/
     ```

6. **charts.lock** and **charts.yaml** (optional):
   - These files are used to track and manage chart dependencies, similar to a package manager's lockfile and metadata file.

7. **README.md** (optional):
   - This file can provide documentation and usage instructions for the Helm chart.

8. **LICENSE** (optional):
   - This file contains the licensing information for the Helm chart.

9. **tests/** (optional):
   - This directory can contain test files and scripts to verify the correctness of the chart's deployment.

Helm uses these components to package, deploy, and manage applications on Kubernetes clusters. It provides a convenient way to customize configurations, manage dependencies, and version control your application deployments, making it easier to maintain complex Kubernetes setups and promote reusability of application configurations.
