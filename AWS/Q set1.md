## what is aws and its component?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a widely used cloud computing platform offered by Amazon. AWS provides a vast array of services and resources for building, deploying, and managing applications and infrastructure in the cloud. Its components include computing services like Amazon EC2 for virtual servers, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, storage services such as Amazon S3 for scalable object storage, and databases like Amazon RDS and DynamoDB. AWS also offers networking tools like Amazon VPC for creating private networks, and it provides various developer tools, machine learning services, analytics, and security features, making it a comprehensive cloud platform for businesses and developers to build and scale applications easily.

## what are key-pair in aws?
In AWS, a key pair is a set of cryptographic keys that consists of a public key and a private key. Key pairs are primarily used for secure authentication and access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. When you create an EC2 instance, you can associate a key pair with it. The public key is placed on the instance, and the private key is kept securely by the user. When you want to connect to the instance, you use the private key to authenticate, ensuring secure access to your virtual server. Key pairs are crucial for securing access to EC2 instances and are an essential component of AWS's security infrastructure.

## what is s3?
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a highly scalable and versatile cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to store and retrieve vast amounts of data, making it ideal for a wide range of use cases, including data backup and archival, content distribution, application data storage, and more. S3 offers durable and reliable storage with a 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability guarantee, meaning data stored in S3 is highly resilient. It also provides various features such as data versioning, data encryption, access control through bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs), and seamless integration with other AWS services. S3 is organized into buckets, each of which can store an unlimited number of objects (files) with unique keys. It is a fundamental building block for many AWS applications and is widely used for storing and serving static website content, media files, backups, and as a data lake for analytics.

## what is pricing model for ec2 instances?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances in AWS follow a flexible and pay-as-you-go pricing model. The pricing for EC2 instances is based on several factors, including:

1. **Instance Type**: The cost varies depending on the type of EC2 instance you choose. Different instance types offer varying levels of compute power, memory, and specialized capabilities.

2. **Region**: AWS has multiple regions worldwide, and the pricing can vary slightly depending on the region where you launch your EC2 instances.

3. **Operating System**: The choice of operating system (e.g., Linux, Windows) can affect the pricing, as Windows instances are typically more expensive due to licensing costs.

4. **Instance Tenancy**: You can choose between On-Demand, Reserved, or Spot instances. On-Demand instances are charged at an hourly rate with no long-term commitment. Reserved instances offer lower costs for a one- or three-year term, but require an upfront payment. Spot instances provide the most cost-effective pricing but are subject to availability and can be terminated if the spot price exceeds your bid.

5. **Instance Size and Configuration**: The number of vCPUs, amount of memory (RAM), and other instance specifications affect the price.

6. **Usage Time**: You pay for the compute capacity you use, so the total cost depends on the number of hours or seconds your instances are running.

7. **Additional Features**: Additional services such as Elastic Block Store (EBS) storage, data transfer, and other AWS services used in conjunction with your EC2 instances can contribute to the overall cost.

## Diff types of instances?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a wide variety of EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances, each designed for specific use cases and workloads. These instances are categorized into several families, each with its own set of characteristics. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, here are some of the key instance types and families:

1. **General Purpose Instances (T2, M4, M5, M6, M7)**:
   - T2: Burstable instances suitable for low to moderate workloads.
   - M4, M5, M6, M7: Balanced instances with a good mix of CPU and memory resources, suitable for a wide range of applications.

2. **Compute Optimized Instances (C4, C5, C6)**:
   - C4, C5, C6: Instances optimized for CPU-intensive workloads such as batch processing and scientific computing.

3. **Memory Optimized Instances (R3, R4, R5, R6, X1, X2, X3)**:
   - R3, R4, R5, R6: Instances designed for memory-intensive applications like databases and in-memory analytics.
   - X1, X2, X3: Extremely high memory instances for in-memory databases and applications.

4. **Accelerated Computing Instances (P2, P3, G2, G3, F1, Inf1, G4dn)**:
   - P2, P3: Instances with powerful GPUs, suitable for machine learning and high-performance computing (HPC).
   - G2, G3, G4dn: GPU instances for graphics-intensive applications and machine learning.
   - F1: FPGA-based instances for custom hardware acceleration.
   - Inf1: Instances with AWS Inferentia chips for AI inference workloads.

5. **Storage Optimized Instances (D2, H1, I3, I3en, D3)**:
   - D2: Dense storage instances for data warehousing and big data analytics.
   - H1: HDD-based instances for high-throughput, big data workloads.
   - I3, I3en: SSD-based instances for I/O-intensive applications and databases.
   - D3: Dense storage HDD-based instances for data-intensive workloads.

## what is aws lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It enables developers to build and deploy applications as individual functions that are triggered by various events, such as changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket, updates to a database, HTTP requests via API Gateway, or custom events from other AWS services. Lambda automatically scales the execution of these functions in response to the incoming workload, ensuring that you pay only for the compute time consumed by your code.

## what is CRR IN AWS?
In Amazon Web Services (AWS), CRR stands for Cross-Region Replication. It is a feature used in AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) that allows you to replicate objects (files or data) from one S3 bucket in one AWS region to another S3 bucket in a different AWS region. This helps in achieving data redundancy, disaster recovery, and low-latency access to data in different geographical locations. CRR ensures that data is automatically and asynchronously copied to a designated destination bucket, making it a valuable tool for data backup and ensuring high availability of data across regions.

## what is cloudfront?
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to improve the performance, security, and scalability of web applications and websites by distributing content to multiple edge locations worldwide. CloudFront accelerates the delivery of static and dynamic web content, such as images, videos, JavaScript files, and APIs, to end-users by caching this content at edge locations that are geographically closer to them. This reduces latency and provides a better user experience. Additionally, CloudFront offers features like DDoS protection, SSL/TLS encryption, and integration with other AWS services, making it a powerful tool for optimizing the delivery of web content and applications.
