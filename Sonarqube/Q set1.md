## what are you evalute in sonar?
In sonar, various parameters are evaluated to analyze underwater environments and detect objects submerged in water. These evaluations typically include measuring the time taken for sound waves to travel to an object and back (sonar's primary function), which helps determine distance and object size. Additionally, sonar systems assess the strength and characteristics of the returning echoes to infer an object's composition, shape, and movement, providing crucial information for applications such as navigation, fish detection, and underwater mapping.
