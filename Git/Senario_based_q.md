## what is branching strategy when bug in production?
When a bug is discovered in a production environment, it's crucial to have a well-defined branching strategy in place to effectively address and resolve the issue while minimizing disruption to the production system. A common branching strategy used in software development for handling production bugs is known as "hotfix" or "emergency fix" branching strategy. Here's how it typically works:

1. **Isolate the Bug:**
   - First, identify and isolate the specific bug that needs to be fixed. This may involve gathering information about the bug, its impact, and the circumstances under which it occurs.

2. **Create a Hotfix Branch:**
   - Once the bug is identified, create a new branch in your version control system specifically for the hotfix. This branch should be separate from your regular development branches (e.g., the main or development branch).

3. **Fix the Bug:**
   - In the hotfix branch, work on fixing the bug. Keep the changes focused and minimal to reduce the risk of introducing new issues.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the bug fix thoroughly in the hotfix branch to ensure that it addresses the issue without causing regressions or new problems. Automated testing and manual testing can both be important here.

5. **Review and Quality Assurance:**
   - Depending on your team's processes, have the fix reviewed by other team members or perform a code review to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.

6. **Merge into Production:**
   - Once the bug fix is validated and deemed ready for production, merge the hotfix branch into the production branch directly. This action should trigger a deployment of the hotfix to the production environment. Ensure that proper deployment procedures are followed.

7. **Monitor and Verify:**
   - After deploying the hotfix to production, closely monitor the system to verify that the bug is indeed fixed and that no new issues have been introduced. This may involve continuous monitoring, logging, and alerting.

8. **Communication:**
   - Throughout this process, maintain clear communication with stakeholders, including customers, about the bug, its resolution, and any potential downtime or disruptions.

9. **Long-term Fix:**
   - While the hotfix addresses the immediate issue, it's important to plan for a more comprehensive, long-term fix as part of your regular development cycle to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.

10. **Documentation:**
    - Document the bug, the hotfix, and the long-term solution (if applicable) in your project's documentation to ensure that the knowledge is shared with the team and can be referred to in the future.

Remember that the hotfix branch is temporary and should only contain changes related to the specific bug. Once the fix is successfully deployed and verified in production, you can consider merging the changes from the hotfix branch into your regular development branches to ensure that the fix is included in future releases.

Look into the changes in last "3" commits.

## when branch is push to remote repo. and remove from all of the member local machine so how will be recover it ?
If a branch has been pushed to a remote repository and then deleted from all members' local machines, you can still recover it from the remote repository as long as it hasn't been deleted from the remote repository. Here's how you can recover a branch:

1. **Check the Remote Repository:**
   - Confirm that the branch still exists in the remote repository. You can do this by visiting the repository on the hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) or by using the following command:

   ```bash
   git ls-remote --heads origin
   ```

   Replace `origin` with the name of your remote if it's different.

2. **Fetch the Branch:**
   - If the branch is still in the remote repository, you can fetch it to your local repository using:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin <branch_name>:<branch_name>
   ```

   Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you want to recover. This command will fetch the branch from the remote repository and create or update a local branch with the same name.

3. **Checkout the Branch:**
   - After fetching the branch, you can switch to it using the `git checkout` command:

   ```bash
   git checkout <branch_name>
   ```

   Now, you should have the branch recovered locally.

If the branch has been deleted from the remote repository as well, then the recovery process becomes more challenging. In such cases, you may need to rely on backups or contact the repository administrators to see if they have a backup of the branch.

It's important to maintain good Git practices, including regularly pushing branches to the remote repository and considering branch deletion carefully, as remote branches can be recovered more easily than deleted local branches.
